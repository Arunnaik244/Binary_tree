## 🛠️ Description

Implementation of a binary tree in python. 
It allows the creation, modification, and printing of a binary tree data structure.

## ⚙️ Languages or Frameworks Used

The program was created with Python3.

<!-- Modules required to be able to use the script successfully
and how to install them.
(If there are a lot of them, including a `requirements.txt` file will work better.) -->

## 🌟 How to run

`python ./main.py` to execute a test case of the code.

**Methods:**\
 _getRoot()_ - Return root of the binary tree\
 _add(data)_ - Add data's value onto the binary tree as a node\
 _find(data)_ - Find the node that contains data in the binary tree\
 _deleteTree()_ - Delete the binary tree\
 _printTree()_ - Prints all node values in the binary tree onto console
